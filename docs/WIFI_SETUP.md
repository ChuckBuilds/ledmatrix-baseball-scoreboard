# WiFi Setup Feature

The LED Matrix project includes a WiFi setup feature that allows you to configure WiFi connections through a web interface. When the Raspberry Pi is not connected to WiFi, it automatically broadcasts an access point (AP) that you can connect to for initial setup.

## Features

- **Automatic AP Mode**: When no WiFi connection is detected, the Raspberry Pi automatically creates a WiFi access point named "LEDMatrix-Setup"
- **Web Interface**: Access the WiFi setup interface through your web browser
- **Network Scanning**: Scan for available WiFi networks from the web interface
- **Secure Connection**: Save WiFi credentials securely
- **Automatic Management**: The WiFi monitor daemon automatically enables/disables AP mode based on connection status

## Requirements

The following packages are required for WiFi setup functionality:

- **hostapd**: Access point software
- **dnsmasq**: DHCP server for AP mode
- **NetworkManager** (or **iwlist**): WiFi management tools

These packages are automatically checked and can be installed during the WiFi monitor service installation.

## Installation

### 1. Install WiFi Monitor Service

Run the installation script to set up the WiFi monitor daemon:

```bash
cd /home/ledpi/LEDMatrix
sudo ./install_wifi_monitor.sh
```

This script will:
- Check for required packages and offer to install them
- Create the systemd service file
- Enable and start the WiFi monitor service
- Configure the service to start on boot

### 2. Verify Service Status

Check that the WiFi monitor service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ledmatrix-wifi-monitor
```

You should see output indicating the service is active and running.

## Usage

### Accessing the WiFi Setup Interface

1. **If WiFi is NOT connected**: The Raspberry Pi will automatically create an access point
   - Connect to the WiFi network: **LEDMatrix-Setup**
   - Password: **ledmatrix123** (default)
   - Open a web browser and navigate to: `http://192.168.4.1:5000`
   - Or use the IP address shown in the web interface

2. **If WiFi IS connected**: Access the web interface normally
   - Navigate to: `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000`
   - Click on the **WiFi** tab in the navigation

### Connecting to a WiFi Network

1. Navigate to the **WiFi** tab in the web interface
2. Click **Scan** to search for available networks
3. Select a network from the dropdown menu, or enter the SSID manually
4. Enter the WiFi password (leave empty for open networks)
5. Click **Connect**
6. The system will attempt to connect to the selected network
7. Once connected, AP mode will automatically disable

### Manual AP Mode Control

You can manually enable or disable AP mode from the web interface:

- **Enable AP Mode**: Click "Enable AP Mode" button (only available when WiFi is not connected)
- **Disable AP Mode**: Click "Disable AP Mode" button (only available when AP mode is active)

## How It Works

### WiFi Monitor Daemon

The WiFi monitor daemon (`wifi_monitor_daemon.py`) runs as a background service that:

1. Checks WiFi connection status every 30 seconds (configurable)
2. Automatically enables AP mode if no WiFi connection is detected
3. Automatically disables AP mode when WiFi connection is established
4. Logs all state changes for troubleshooting

### WiFi Manager Module

The WiFi manager (`src/wifi_manager.py`) provides:

- **Connection Status**: Checks current WiFi connection state
- **Network Scanning**: Scans for available WiFi networks
- **Connection Management**: Connects to WiFi networks and saves credentials
- **AP Mode Control**: Manages access point mode (hostapd/dnsmasq)

### Configuration

WiFi settings are stored in `config/wifi_config.json`:

```json
{
  "ap_ssid": "LEDMatrix-Setup",
  "ap_password": "ledmatrix123",
  "ap_channel": 7,
  "saved_networks": [
    {
      "ssid": "MyNetwork",
      "password": "mypassword",
      "saved_at": 1234567890.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Access Point Configuration

The AP mode uses `hostapd` and `dnsmasq` for access point functionality:

- **SSID**: LEDMatrix-Setup (configurable)
- **IP Range**: 192.168.4.2 - 192.168.4.20
- **Gateway**: 192.168.4.1
- **Channel**: 7 (configurable)

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Monitor Service Not Starting

Check the service logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix-wifi-monitor -n 50
```

Common issues:
- Missing packages (hostapd, dnsmasq)
- Permission issues
- Network interface not available

### Cannot Access AP Mode

1. Check if AP mode is active:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status hostapd
   ```

2. Check if dnsmasq is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
   ```

3. Verify WiFi interface exists:
   ```bash
   ip link show wlan0
   ```

### Cannot Connect to WiFi Network

1. Verify the SSID and password are correct
2. Check if the network requires a password (some networks may appear open but require a password)
3. Check WiFi monitor logs for connection errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix-wifi-monitor -f
   ```

4. Check NetworkManager logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -n 50
   ```

### AP Mode Not Disabling

If AP mode doesn't disable after connecting to WiFi:

1. Check WiFi connection status:
   ```bash
   nmcli device status
   ```

2. Manually disable AP mode from the web interface
3. Restart the WiFi monitor service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ledmatrix-wifi-monitor
   ```

## Service Management

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ledmatrix-wifi-monitor

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start ledmatrix-wifi-monitor

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ledmatrix-wifi-monitor

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart ledmatrix-wifi-monitor

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix-wifi-monitor -f

# Disable service from starting on boot
sudo systemctl disable ledmatrix-wifi-monitor

# Enable service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable ledmatrix-wifi-monitor
```

### Configuration Options

You can modify the check interval by editing the service file:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit ledmatrix-wifi-monitor
```

Or modify the service file directly:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ledmatrix-wifi-monitor.service
```

Change the `--interval` parameter in the `ExecStart` line (default is 30 seconds).

After modifying, reload and restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ledmatrix-wifi-monitor
```

## Security Considerations

- **Default AP Password**: The default AP password is "ledmatrix123". Consider changing this in `config/wifi_config.json` for production use
- **WiFi Credentials**: Saved WiFi credentials are stored in `config/wifi_config.json`. Ensure proper file permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod 600 config/wifi_config.json
  ```
- **Network Access**: When in AP mode, anyone within range can connect to the setup network. Use strong passwords for production deployments

## API Endpoints

The WiFi setup feature exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v3/wifi/status` - Get current WiFi connection status
- `GET /api/v3/wifi/scan` - Scan for available WiFi networks
- `POST /api/v3/wifi/connect` - Connect to a WiFi network
- `POST /api/v3/wifi/ap/enable` - Enable access point mode
- `POST /api/v3/wifi/ap/disable` - Disable access point mode

## Technical Details

### WiFi Detection Methods

The WiFi manager tries multiple methods to detect WiFi status:

1. **NetworkManager (nmcli)** - Preferred method if available
2. **iwconfig** - Fallback method for systems without NetworkManager

### Network Scanning

The system supports multiple scanning methods:

1. **nmcli** - Fast, preferred method
2. **iwlist** - Fallback method for older systems

### Access Point Setup

AP mode configuration:

- Uses `hostapd` for WiFi access point functionality
- Uses `dnsmasq` for DHCP and DNS services
- Configures wlan0 interface in AP mode
- Provides DHCP range: 192.168.4.2-20
- Gateway IP: 192.168.4.1

## Development

### Testing WiFi Manager

You can test the WiFi manager directly:

```python
from src.wifi_manager import WiFiManager

# Create WiFi manager instance
wifi_manager = WiFiManager()

# Get status
status = wifi_manager.get_wifi_status()
print(f"Connected: {status.connected}, SSID: {status.ssid}")

# Scan networks
networks = wifi_manager.scan_networks()
for net in networks:
    print(f"{net.ssid}: {net.signal}% ({net.security})")

# Connect to network
success, message = wifi_manager.connect_to_network("MyNetwork", "password")
print(f"Connection: {success}, Message: {message}")
```

### Running Monitor Daemon Manually

For testing, you can run the daemon in foreground mode:

```bash
sudo python3 wifi_monitor_daemon.py --interval 10 --foreground
```
